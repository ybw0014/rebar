/**
 * A block that interacts with fluids in some way.
 *
 * This is a very flexible class which requires you to define exactly how fluid should
 * be input and output. You are responsible for keeping track of any state, like how
 * much fluid is stored.
 *
 * Most fluid blocks can use [RebarFluidBufferBlock] or [RebarFluidTank] instead.
 *
 * This interface allowed you to request fluids from input points, supply fluids to
 * output points, and specify how to add/remove fluids from your block.
 *
 * Multiple inputs/outputs are not supported. You can have at most 1 input and 1 output.
 *
 *
 * @see RebarFluidBufferBlock
