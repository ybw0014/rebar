    /**
     * Furnaces have a recipe cache of the last recipe smelted, this is great
     * for performance but has an unexpected side effect once rebar items are introduced.
     *
     * Lets say you have a furnace with nothing cached and you put in a raw tin (rebar item) to smelt.
     * The furnace is going to search for a recipe that matches and there are 2 possible choices
     * 1. the raw tin -> tin ingot recipe, supplied by rebar using exact choice
     * 2. the raw iron -> iron ingot recipe, supplied by Minecraft, using material choice, so it validates even if the item is a rebar item
     *
     * Even if it picks the vanilla recipe, when it starts smelting & finishes smelting, rebar will ensure
     * the rebar recipe is used instead.
     *
     * However, the furnace itself has no way of knowing that we changed which recipe was used, so if the vanilla recipe was used
     * it will cache the vanilla recipe. Then, when it tries to start smelting another raw tin, it will check that it can fit
     * the result of the next valid recipe, which is evaluated to the cached vanilla recipe, and it will find that it can't, because a tin ingot
     * is in the result slot, not the iron ingot. This then deadlocks the furnace in a feedback loop of use the vanilla recipe, oh can't fit it.
     *
     * In order to avoid this, whenever we override the recipe being used, we set the recipe in the recipe cache so that next time
     * the furnace smelts, it uses the correct recipe and doesn't get deadlocked.
